# springdata-Jpa
In this example I will show how to use spring data JPA to create and retrieve the total number of records. This example uses H2 database.
Below is the URL to access H2 console(9080 is the port that is configured in application.properties)
http://localhost:9080/h2-console
To view the table created in the code, add jdbc url as jdbd:h2:mem:testdb 
In the above jdbc url, testdb is the default schema
